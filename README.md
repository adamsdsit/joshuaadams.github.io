## 🚀 Overview

This is a **static-site** powered by a simple Python + Jinja2 generator and deployed to GitHub Pages. It supports:

- **Resume & CV** — modern, responsive “cards” layout  
- **Research & Publications** — academic listings  
- **Teaching** — syllabi, philosophy, timelines  
- **Business Continuity** — professional experience  
- **Projects** — case studies  
- **Hobbies** — photo/video gallery  
- **Blog** — Markdown-based posts  
- **Multi-language** — English + 日本語  
- **Dark/Light mode** toggle  

All site-wide settings, nav links and per-page metadata live in `content/site_data.json`; the rest is pure Jinja2 templates + CSS/JS.
