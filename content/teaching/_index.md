## Teaching Philosophy

My teaching philosophy centers on experiential, project-based learning that equips students with both conceptual understanding and practical skills. I emphasize real-world problem solving, ethical reasoning, and adaptability in rapidly evolving technical environments.

Across my courses, students engage directly with industry-relevant tools and platforms—including cloud infrastructure, cybersecurity tooling, and software engineering workflows—to develop confidence and workforce readiness.
